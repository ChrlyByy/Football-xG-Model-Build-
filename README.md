# Football Expected Goals (xG) Predictor

A logistic regression model built in Python to predict the likelihood of a football shot resulting in a goal, based on shot location and contextual event data. This project demonstrates the full data science pipeline: data acquisition, cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and insight generation.

Project Overview

Expected Goals (xG) is a core football analytics metric that quantifies the quality of a scoring chance. This project:
- Trains a logistic regression model on historical shot data.
- Engineers interpretable features like shot distance and angle.
- Evaluates model performance using probability-aware metrics.
- Applies the model to analyze attacking performance in the current season.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:** Python, Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, Logistic Regression, Statistical Evaluation, Data Visualization, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks.
